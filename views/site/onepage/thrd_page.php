                <p>
                    I was born in Houston and grew up in Fredericksburg, TX. 
                    I was a cheerleader as a kid, ran for one of those crazy local pageants (Peach Queen), 
                    went to almost every county fair, and floated rivers more times than I can count, 
                    in the nearly 20 years I lived and grew up there.
                    Now I live part time in Paris, Vienna, and more and more rarely these days, Texas. 
                    The Texas necklace on the other page is my own that I’ve had since 
                    I first moved away for school.

                <p>
                    I was born in Stuttgart (Germany) and grew up half time in the city and half time on the 
                    country sight. I made a lot of sports, exspecialy Tennis! While working hard on the sand
                    courts I'll always loved programming and creating arts on the computer. I although love to paint
                    real pictures;) Since 6 years I'm living in Vienna - working as a BI consultant - and now getting the chance to visit Texas,
                    where I think the most adorable girl I know got raised.

            <p class="bg-color-darken opacity">
                I’ve always been interested in how proud Texans are of their home, 
                how beautiful so much of the state is, and the so many ways that people show 
                their love of our state. Since I’ve moved away, 
                I’ve been asked some of the craziest questions about Texas, 
                seen countless friends move there and start families of their own there, 
                and had a great time sharing food and traditions from growing up.
                I thought this book would be a great way to highlight some of the things 
                I know and love about home. It obviously won’t tell the story of how everyone 
                feels about Texas. There’s 26-something million of you in the state alone not even 
                counting those of us who have moved, but it can tell some of those stories. 
                And I hope it will be a great one you want to share.
